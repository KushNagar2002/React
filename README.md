# ReactElement is an object then it gets converted into HTML  that Browser Understands.
# React Components are of 2 types: 
    - 1: Function Based Component (New Way)
    - 2: Class based Component (Old way)
# Component Composition => is when we call one function component into the other.

# JSX code is transpiled before it reaches the JS
    - This is transpiled using parcel and parcel uses babel to do that.

# JSX => React.creatElement => ReactElement-JS Object => HTML Element (render).

# Passing a Prop to the function is same like passing Arguments to the function. 

# Always give key while working with the map.

# React don't recommend using index as a key in map.

# Two types of Export/Import
    - Deafult Import/Export
        -> export default Components;
        -> import Components from "path";

    - Named Import/Export
        -> export const Component;
        -> import {Component} from "path";

# React Hooks
- Normal JS utility functions
- There are 2 very important Hooks:-
    - useState() - Superpowerful state variable in react
        -> We can import this how named import works
    - useEffect() 
        -> Use effect will be called with the 2 arguments which is (callback function) and (Dependency).
        -> It will first render the whole component then it will render itself.
